                <h2 className="emphasis-text">Hi! I'm Erin,</h2> 
                <p>I'm a full stack software engineer in the Bay Area.
                </p>
                <p>I used to work in community mental health, and before that education. Because of this experience, I highly value collaboration, kindness, a growth-mindset, and empathy in my teammates.</p>
                <p>While the work of an engineer is quite different on the surface from being an educator or a mental health worker, it hasn't changed my mission to help with the creation, accessibility, and dissemination of useful tools. The details may have changed, but my core motivation is the same.</p>
