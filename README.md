# Welcome! I'm Erin Halden, aka erininabox

This is the code base for my first iteration of my portfolio website. 

## Technologies Used
My primary training is in React, and thus, this is also the primary technology used for this site. Supporting this, I also used Express.js and Node.js. 

## Future Plans
I'm currently rebuilding my website. I plan to incorporate Next.js and SASS in order to streamline the development process a little. I want to also incorporate MongoDB and full CRUD in order to streamline adding/updating project information. I'm also exploring alternatives that might be more streamlined, including implementing a WordPress CMS template. 

I'm also working on an update to the current design. I'm not a designer by training, but I recognize that my current succulent-centric design appeals probably only to a certain demographic; it's dated. It's a challenge to update the design, but one that's interesting and worth the time.
